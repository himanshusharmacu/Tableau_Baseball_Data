# Tableau_Baseball_Data
In this project, i had used Tableau to build dashboards and tell a story with data. This is an essential skill as an analyst. I had explored data from Baseball Data( A data set from kaggle )  to draw out and display interesting patterns.  I  started by defining some leading questions, then exploring the data to find answers, and finally build visualizations to communicate those answers and tell a story.

# Step One - Choose a Data Set
-> First, you will choose a data set from the Data Set Options document or find a data set to explore and visualize. You should choose a data set based on your prior experiences in programming and working with data. The data set you choose will not increase or decrease your chances of passing this project.

# Step Two - Get Organized
-> Eventually you’ll want to submit your project and share it. To do so, you need to create a zip folder that includes the following:

* Write-up: PDF or Markdown file that includes links to your Tableau Public workbooks, published online, and a write-up with four sections. See HERE if you need help publishing your Tableau Public Workbook.
* Summary: in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it
* Design: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
* Feedback: include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization
* Resources: list any sources you consulted to create your visualization
-> Data Files
the final data set used to create the visualization (usually .csv, .tsv, or .json file)
a codebook or other files related to the data set (description, readme, license)
# Step Three - Find a Data Story
-> Explore your data set and craft a message or story around your data! Think about the overall message you want to convey and think about the comparison(s) or relationship(s) you want your readers to see. Remember that you will ultimately need to create a visualization that is explanatory, helping lead a reader to identify one or more key insights into the dataset. Feel free to use whatever visualization and data analysis tools you feel comfortable with using at this point in the process.

# Step Four - Create Your Visualization
First, sketch ideas for your visualization. Once you settle on a sketch, explain any design choices in that sketch, such as chart type, visual encodings, and layout, in the Design section of the write-up. Then, create your visualization using Tableau. The visualization must include animation, interaction, or both. See the Project Rubric for more information.

# Step Five - Get Feedback
Share your visualization with at least one other person and document their feedback. There are many ways to get feedback, and more feedback is generally better! Here are some options.

Share your visualization with others in person and have them think aloud as they read and explore the graphic so you can document what stands out to them and how they interpret the graphic.
Share a link to your project in your Study Group, or Slack community, depending on what version of the program you are in, and ask others to share their constructive criticisms. Be sure to offer advice to others who are seeking feedback too!
You might need to ask specific questions to prompt the reader. Here are some questions to help you. You can, of course, ask others.

* What do you notice in the visualization?
* What questions do you have about the data?
* What relationships do you notice?
* What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
* Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
# Step Six - Document Feedback and Improve the Visualization
* For each person that gives you feedback, add the person’s feedback to your write-up file in the Feedback section. As you improve and iterate on your visualization, update the visualization AND describe any changes in the Design section of the write-up.

* You should save multiple versions of your data visualization after you make changes to it. Remember to save related files with similar numbers.

* When should you save your files? You should save your files whenever you have a working version of your data visualization. If you get feedback and make changes, then create a new file and save the file as another version.

* Your goal is to build evidence that you have shared your visualization, received feedback, and responded to that feedback. You need to submit an initial version of your data visualization and the final version with the corresponding write-up.

# Step Seven - Review
Use the Project Rubric to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you’re ready to submit your project. If you see room for improvement, keep working to improve your project!
